## Learning Git

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Most of the things we discuss here are not only achievable with Git, but can be made with other VCS as well</li>
<li>I am a total Git-Fanboy, whatever I say during this workshop is totally opinionated</li>

## Requirements

If you know how to type commands in a terminal and parse its output, this training is made for you!

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Reading is crucial here, by the end of the training you&#39;ll be using the <em>man</em>-pages a lot!</li>
<li>No specific Git editor integration is discussed, since none of them covers all of Git&#39;s features (and none of them does it in the same way)</li>
<li>For the same reason, no Git GUI is discussed</li>
<li>I recommend using the terminal all of the time and start using other tools, if they make you more efficient than when using the console (there are many situations in which other tools are more efficient)</li>
<li>In many occasions you&#39;ll find yourself connected to a server with a Git repository doing analysis, knowing the commands in that situation is crucial</li>

## Git

"... is oddly liberal with how and when you use it."

* is a powerful analysis tool
* allows running automated tasks
* allows many collaboration workflows
* allows patch management

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Git does not force you to suit certain workflows, it doesn&#39;t get in your way</li>

## Git

* has crazy command line syntax
* has a leaky abstraction

<li>beginners are confronted with internal details</li>

## Setup

Create a repository:

```shell
$ mkdir -p ~/working/directory/ && cd $_ && git init .
Initialized empty Git repository in ~/working/directory/.git/
```

```shell
$ ls -blah
total 0
drwxr-xr-x. 3 escodebar escodebar  60 Jul 15 18:04 .

drwxrwxr-x. 7 escodebar escodebar 200 Jul 15 18:04 .git
```

See that `.git` folder there? That's the repository.

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>During this training a toy repository is used</li>
<li>We will be adding changes to the repository during the training to confront you with typical Git situations</li>
<li>Everything tracked by Git is inside the repository. Everything! Seriously... everything! Or almost everything!</li>
<li>If there is something you want to backup, then it&#39;s the <code>.git</code> folder... but&#39;s let&#39;s discuss that later</li>

Behold, run this in a separate terminal!

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Open a second terminal window and navigate to the repository&#39;s repository to switch context easier</li>
<li>Git keeps track of all the changes, it is therefore a perfect analysis tool</li>
<li>Most Git commands go up the directory path to the point where they find a <code>.git</code> folder, but &quot;ignore&quot; its contents</li>
<li>Therefore we can create a repository in the repository to track the changes and understand Git&#39;s behavior</li>
<li>If you do not remember what happens when you run a specific command, you can look it up later in the &quot;Gitception&quot; repository</li>
<li>Ignore the added files for now, most of them are discussed later during the training</li>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>The <code>COMMIT_EDITMSG</code> is used to temporarily store the message of the commit</li>
<li>The logs keep track of the commit hashes the references pointed to, they become handy when branches are lost (more about this later)</li>
<li>There is also a log for the <code>HEAD</code> (more about the <code>HEAD</code> later)</li>
<li>References (or refs here) are discussed later - see the <code>master</code> there again?</li>

What is the object with the commit's hash?
```shell

Let's take a look at the status:

  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Changes to be committed:
	new file:   whiskeys.md

  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
	both modified:   README.md

Take a look at the conflicting files:
