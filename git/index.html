## Requirements

If you know how to type commands in a terminal and parse its output, this training is made for you!

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Reading is crucial here, by the end of the training you&#39;ll be using the <em>man</em>-pages a lot!</li>
<li>No specific Git editor integration is discussed, since none of them covers all of Git&#39;s features (and none of them does it in the same way)</li>
<li>For the same reason, no Git GUI is discussed</li>
<li>I recommend using the terminal all of the time and start using other tools, if they make you more efficient than when using the console (there are many situations in which other tools are more efficient)</li>
<li>In many occasions you&#39;ll find yourself connected to a server with a Git repository doing analysis, knowing the commands in that situation is crucial</li>

## Git

"... is oddly liberal with how and when you use it."

* is a powerful analysis tool
* allows running automated tasks
* allows many collaboration workflows
* allows patch management

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Git does not force you to suit certain workflows, it doesn&#39;t get in your way</li>

## Git

... is utterly complex

* has crazy command line syntax
* has a leaky abstraction

<li>no distinction between implementation detail and user interface</li>
<li>beginners are confronted with internal details</li>

## Slides

[https://escodebar.github.io/trainings/git/](https://escodebar.github.io/trainings/git/)

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>You can find the speaker notes in the slides, which allows you to go through the training at home</li>
<li>Pass the slides to your coworkers, your friends, etc., the more people understand Git the better</li>
<li>If a slide needs clarification, please let me know!</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Setup

[Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and tell it who you are
```shell
$ git config --global user.name "Pablo Escodebar"

$ git config --global user.email "escodebar@gmail.com"

```

Then configure the editor you want to use
```shell
$ git config --global core.editor 'vim'
$ git config --global core.editor 'subl -n -w'
$ git config --global core.editor 'atom --wait'
$ git config --global core.editor 'code --wait'
```

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Whenever you do something in Git, your user will be used to track your actions</li>
<li>There are three levels of configuration:<ul>
<li>The repository configuration</li>
<li>Your user configuration (using <code>--global</code>)</li>
<li>The system configuration (using <code>--system</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can also configure the editor, the default editor is <code>vim</code></li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Setup

Create a repository:

```shell
$ mkdir -p ~/working/directory/ && cd $_ && git init .
Initialized empty Git repository in ~/working/directory/.git/
```

```shell
$ ls -blah
total 0
drwxr-xr-x. 3 escodebar escodebar  60 Jun 16 00:04 .
drwx------. 3 escodebar escodebar  60 Jun 16 00:04 ..
drwxrwxr-x. 7 escodebar escodebar 200 Jun 16 00:04 .git
```

See that `.git` folder there? That's the repository.

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>During this training a toy repository is used</li>
<li>We will be adding changes to the repository during the training to confront you with typical Git situations</li>
<li>Everything tracked by Git is inside the repository. Everything! Seriously... everything! Or almost everything!</li>
<li>If there is something you want to backup, then it&#39;s the <code>.git</code> folder... but&#39;s let&#39;s discuss that later</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Digging deeper

Don't panic!

```shell
$ ls -blah .git
total 12K
drwxrwxr-x. 7 escodebar escodebar 200 Jun 16 00:04 .
drwxr-xr-x. 3 escodebar escodebar  60 Jun 16 00:04 ..

## Gitception

Behold, run this in a separate terminal!
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

```shell
$ cd ~/working/directory/.git

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

We are creating a repository inside the repository

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Open a second terminal window and navigate to the repository&#39;s repository to switch context easier</li>
<li>Git keeps track of all the changes, it is therefore a perfect analysis tool</li>
<li>Most Git commands go up the directory path to the point where they find a <code>.git</code> folder, but &quot;ignore&quot; its contents</li>
<li>Therefore we can create a repository in the repository to track the changes and understand Git&#39;s behavior</li>
<li>If you do not remember what happens when you run a specific command, you can look it up later in the &quot;Gitception&quot; repository</li>
<li>Ignore the added files for now, most of them are discussed later during the training</li>
<li>I haven&#39;t seen an other Git training doing this! Let me know if you like this idea!</li>

...once you resolved the conflicts:
```shell
$ git add README.md

and run
```shell
$ git merge --continue

to open your editor to write the commit's message

or commit yourself directly
```shell
$ git commit -m "Add the list of beers first"

## Non obvious conflicts

Sometimes conflicts are introduced, which are not obvious to Git:

If one of the branches changes the behavior of a part of the code and the old behavior is required for the other branch, but there is no conflict within the files... then Git won't alert you!

How do you solve this?

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>There are several ways to solve this, and it is not strictly Git related</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Tests to the rescue!

You can run your tests while rebasing:
```shell
$ git rebase -x "pytest" <newbase>
```

If the tests fail, Git will stop the rebase and allow you to fix your code

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>This requires to have a test which will break when such a conflict arises</li>
<li>If you test your code for behavior, this kind of conflicts are catched</li>
<li>Now go tell Fredrik V. Mørken how he should be using <code>git rebase</code></li>

## There's a shortcut!

...to avoid having to move commits around
```shell
$ git help commit | grep "autosquash" -C 2

       --fixup=<commit>
           Construct a commit message for use with rebase --autosquash. The commit message will be
           the subject line from the specified commit with a prefix of "fixup! ". See git-rebase(1)
           for details.

       --squash=<commit>
           Construct a commit message for use with rebase --autosquash. The commit message subject
           line is taken from the specified commit with a prefix of "squash! ". Can be used with
           additional commit message options (-m/-c/-C/-F). See git-rebase(1) for details.

## Exercises

* Change the order of commits
* Create a `--fixup` or `--squash` commit
* Rebase a branch using the `--autosquash` flag
* Run an interactive rebase with the `-x` option
* Edit a commit during a rebase
* Study `git reset`, `git stash` and `git checkout`

## Let's also push the gitception branch

...for the sake of completeness

```shell
$ git fetch && git push -u github refs/remotes/gitception/master:refs/heads/git/unibe/gitception
remote:
remote: Create a pull request for 'git/unibe/gitception' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/escodebar/trainings/pull/new/git/unibe/gitception
remote:
To github.com:escodebar/trainings.git
 * [new branch]      gitception/master -> git/unibe/gitception
```
<!-- .element: style="font-size: 0.38em" -->

Now you know where to get the repositories for later analysis!

<li>This allows you to push branches between remotes</li>
<li>This workshop is self-contained!</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Excercises

* Run the commands in the previous slides
* Checkout a remote branch
* Create a new branch based on a remote branch
* Think about it: Do you need a local master branch?
* Add a second remote and push a branch to it
* Explain how `git pull` is different from `git fetch`
* Push a local commit to a remote branch
* Read about `git push --mirror`

## Exercices

* Discuss in a group your current workflows

* Discuss where and who manages project complexity with these workflows
* Make a pull request
* Review the code of a pull request

Share a public repository and implement FizzBuzz in TDD communicating only using Git commits.
Also think of a way to establish a common workflow using only Git commits!
